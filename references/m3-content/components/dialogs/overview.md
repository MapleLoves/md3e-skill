# Dialogs

> Dialogs provide important prompts in a user flow

-   Use dialogs to make sure users act on information

-   Two variants: basic Basic dialogs interrupt users with urgent information, details, or actions. They're often used for alerts, quick selection, or confirmation. [More on basic dialogs](/m3/pages/dialogs/guidelines#97ac3858-3932-4084-ae8e-73e42b7cb752) and full-screen Full-screen dialogs fill the entire screen, displaying actions that require a series of tasks to complete. They're often used for creating a calendar entry. [More on full-screen dialogs](/m3/pages/dialogs/guidelines#007536b9-76b1-474a-a152-2f340caaff6f)

-   Should be dedicated to completing a single task

-   Can also display information relevant to the task

-   Commonly used to confirm high-risk actions like deleting progress
