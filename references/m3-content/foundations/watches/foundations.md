## Anatomy

### The watch face

Watch faces display the time, as well as  other information and can provide access to other functions through apps and tiles.

They can also include complications, self-contained details that can show contextual info like heart rate or progress.

Ongoing activities on the watch face show in-progress actions, like a stopwatch countdown or a workout timer.

**Complications** are details on the watch face that can be customized for style or function

**1\. Ongoing activities** , like timers, media players, or workouts, can be accessed from the watch face

### Physical buttons

Wearable devices can have a variety input surfaces, which include physical buttons and controls.

  1. Rotating side buttons: Used for volume control, or to scroll through options or lists

  2. System buttons: Dedicated to OS functions like powering on and off, and cannot be customized

  3. Multifunction buttons: Used by apps for custom actions like starting and stopping a stopwatch

## Design principles

  * Tailor layouts for different screen sizes with [adaptive design](<https://developer.android.com/design/ui/wear/guides/foundations/adaptive-design>)

  * Design for short interactions to conserve battery

  * Focus on one or two tasks at a time rather than a full app experience

  * Test designs in situations that involve movement to make sure the design is usable at a glance

check Do

At-a-glance views allow people to quickly see calendar events

![3 columns with times, dates, and appointment names cut off.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fmp4bdrul-06-dont.png?alt=media&token=e9bc2019-549d-46b7-bc78-782c2ef2ec81)

close Don’t

Don't create complex and detailed apps such as a calendar grid

### Always relevant

Watches are always with people. Consider how to update app content based on context, such as time, place, and activity.

Navigation on a watch complements the experience on a phone

### Works offline

Design for slow connections and offline use, such as exercising and commuting.

![2 watches: 1 with offline music downloads list. 1 with a dialog about no internet connection with dismiss and accept buttons.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fmp4bf7c4-08.png?alt=media&token=f17e3796-9fed-4cd7-9a36-771d26f34e94)

The network state can be communicated through:

  1. An offline icon

  2. A dialog

## Interaction patterns

### Cross-device experiences

Watches are often dependent on connected phones for functionality or complex interactions. In some cases, a watch and a phone are used together to accomplish different parts of the same task.

Consider how experiences can be consistent and complement the strengths of each device.

check Do

Consider which actions are appropriate for each device

### Always on displays

Watches can have always on displays, which allow ambient content to be shown when the watch isn’t in use.

This are especially helpful for ongoing experiences like a timer or a workout that should remain in view. Because they remain on the screen for long time periods, consider limiting the number of pixels that are illuminated.
