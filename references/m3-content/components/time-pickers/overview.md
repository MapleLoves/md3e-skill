## Time pickers

  * Availability & resources
  * Differences from M2

  * Time pickers are modal and cover the main content

  * Two variants:  dial Dial time pickers let people set a time by moving a handle around the dial. They're often used for setting an alarm or calendar event.  and  input Input time pickers allow people to set a time using a keyboard. This option is accessible from any mobile time picker interface via the keyboard icon.

  * People can select hours, minutes, or periods of time

  * Make sure time can easily be selected by hand on a mobile device
