# Canonical layout examples

Canonical layout examples are designs for common screen layouts across all breakpoints

## Canonical layout examples

  * Usage
  * Across breakpoints
  * Behavior

Many layouts can be split into a list view and a detail view.

Key use cases for this layout include parent-child pairings of information like:

  * Text message + conversation

  * File browser + open folder

  * Musical artist + album detail

  * Settings + category detail

  * Email inbox + selected email

  1. List
  2. Detail

## Usage

Use the list-detail layout for quickly accessing details of an item from a long list of content.

Examples include:

  * Showing a series of conversations and a text message

  * Browsing files and seeing their details

  * Browsing multiple albums and seeing individual track information

### Dividing space

![Compact windows have 1 pane, while medium and expanded windows can have 2 panes for list-detailed views.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fmp52wfuu-03.png?alt=media&token=9535e2cb-8fe9-4f55-87cc-c2f55b2ef300)

The most basic list-detail views for compact, medium, and expanded layouts

A list-detail layout uses two panes. Depending on the breakpoint, the two panes may appear together in the same layout or across separate layouts.

List-detail layouts use the same pane guidance as all single and two-pane layouts, including special behavior for foldables.

**Breakpoint (dp)**| **Visible panes**
---|---
Compact (0-599)| 1 pane
Medium (600-839)| 1 (recommended) or 2 panes
Expanded (840+)| 2 panes
Large (1200-1599)| 2 panes
Extra-large (1600+)| 2 panes

## Across breakpoints

### Compact

  * Use a single-pane layout

  * Only one view is visible at a time, either list or detail

![Single-pane layout on 3 devices at compact breakpoints.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fmp533vzf-04.png?alt=media&token=7241c2e9-126a-487b-b74d-e20d62d16fa6)

  1. Phone in portrait orientation

  2. Closed foldable

  3. Tablet in split-screen mode

### Medium

  * Use a single-pane layout for information-dense content or deep focus

![Single-pane layout on a foldable open flat and a tablet in portrait orientation.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fmp535cbt-05.png?alt=media&token=e6487d36-75c2-482d-bd8b-fec3cde0306d)

  1. Foldable open flat

  2. Tablet in portrait orientation

  * Use a two-pane layout to browse collections and switch between items quickly

  * To maximize horizontal space for two-pane layouts, use a bottom  navigation bar Navigation bars let people switch between UI views on smaller devices.  [More on navigation bars](</m3/pages/navigation-bar/overview>) or modal  navigation rail Navigation rails let people switch between UI views on mid-sized devices.

  1. Foldable open flat

  2. Tablet in portrait orientation

### Expanded, large, & extra-large

  * Use a two-pane layout

![2-pane layout on a phone and tablet, both in landscape orientation.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fmp538uu5-07.png?alt=media&token=3348b4ce-14f4-4bc3-ae8b-8bb5a4851f0c)

  1. Phone in landscape orientation
  2. Tablet in landscape orientation

## Behavior

### Single vs two-pane

  * Back button: Appears in detail view only for single-pane layouts

  * Selected state: Appears only in list view for two-pane layouts

  * Visual focus: Use [explicit and implicit grouping](</m3/pages/grids-spacing/spacing#e7e6d1ac-031a-4757-afcf-b223f23654ea>) to direct focus in two-pane layouts

![A 2-pane layout shows a selected list item. A single-pane layout uses a Back button to return to the list.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fmp53b085-08.png?alt=media&token=ee7424e2-9c1c-4669-93cf-2f7aae5b4409)

  1. Use a selection state in two-pane layouts only

  2. Use a back button in single-pane layouts only

### Transitioning between layouts

The amount of available space is dynamic and changes based on how someone uses a device, such as rotating or unfolding it, or entering multi-window mode.

A two-pane layout adapts to a single-pane layout when a device rotates from an expanded to medium breakpoint

#### No selected list item

A single-pane layout shows a list view, while a two-pane layout shows placeholder content in the detail pane.

In some cases, such as multi-select, the most recently used pane should stay visible when switching to single-pane layout.

If no item is selected when a foldable opens, the detail pane displays an empty state

#### Selected list item

When switching from a single- to two-pane layout, both panes should be shown and the selected item’s details are visible.

When going from a two- to single-pane layout, the view depends on the product:

  * The detail pane should typically show in a single-pane layout, and an app bar appears

  * If the product supports selection without deep navigation, like multi-select, the list view can show with the item selected

  * Consistency is key: If a layout showed the list view previously, it should return to that view when returning to a single pane

If an item is selected when a foldable opens, the detail pane shows that item

When a foldable closes with an item selected, the single pane shows the detail view

#### Persistent states

In most cases, a state should be saved when navigating between detail views. This includes read and unread content.

Detail views should retain their scroll position when navigating to other items
