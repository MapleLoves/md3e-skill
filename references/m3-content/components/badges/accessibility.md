# Badges

Badges show notifications, counts, or status information on navigation items and icons

## Badges

  * Use cases
  * Interaction & style
  * Visual indicators
  * Labeling elements

## Use cases

People should be able to use assistive technology to:

  * Understand the dynamic information conveyed in badges, such as counts or labels
  * Address badge announcements by selecting corresponding navigation destinations

## Interaction & style

Badges are most commonly used within other components, such as  navigation bar Navigation bars let people switch between UI views on smaller devices.

[More on navigation rails](</m3/pages/navigation-rail/overview>) ,  app bars App bars display navigation, actions, and text at the top of a screen.  [More on app bars](</m3/pages/app-bars/overview>) , and  tabs Tabs organize content across different screens and views.  [More on tabs](</m3/pages/tabs/overview>) .

When a badge is used to indicate an unread notification, the badge gets hidden once it's selected.

## Visual indicators

Badges use a color intended to stand out against labels, icons, and navigation elements. Use the default color mapping to avoid color conflict issues.
