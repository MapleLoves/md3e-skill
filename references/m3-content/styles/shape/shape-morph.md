# Shape

The M3 shape system includes original shapes, a corner radius scale, and built-in shape morphing

## Shape

  * Using shape morph

The Material shape library supports easy transitioning, or morphing, between shapes. Shape morph is leveraged in the  standard button group Standard button groups add interactions between adjacent buttons when they're pressed.  [More on button groups](</m3/pages/button-groups/overview>) and  loading indicator Loading indicators show the progress of a process with a short wait time.  [More on loading indicators](</m3/pages/loading-indicator/overview>) components.

## Using shape morph

Access to the Material shape library and the shape morph functionality are available through a platform-specific API.

  * For Android, use the [Shapes in Compose API](<https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material3/MaterialShapes>)
  * Web is not currently available

Shape morphing uses the  expressive motion scheme The motion physics system has two schemes: standard for utilitarian movement, and expressive for more bouncy movement.  [More about motion schemes](</m3/pages/motion-overview/how-it-works>) by default. This can be switched to the standard motion scheme as needed.

The Material shape library contains many types of shapes that can all morph seamlessly into each other

The standard button group uses shape morph to show interaction

The loading indicator uses shape morph to show progress
