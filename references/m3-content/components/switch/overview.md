  * Use switches (not  radio buttons Radio buttons let people select one option from a set of options.

## Differences from M2

  * Accessibility: Visual presentation is more accessible

  * Color: New color mappings meet Material's non-text-contrast requirements in addition to compatibility with  dynamic color Dynamic color takes a single color from a user's wallpaper or in-app content and creates an accessible color scheme assigned to elements in the UI.  [More on dynamic color](</m3/pages/dynamic/choosing-a-source>)

  * Icons: Ability to have an optional icon within the switch handle

  * Layout: Track is taller and wider
