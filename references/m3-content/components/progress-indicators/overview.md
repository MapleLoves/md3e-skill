# Progress indicators

> Progress indicators show the status of a process in real time

-   Two variants: linear and circular

-   Use the same configuration for all instances of a process (like loading)

-   They capture attention through motion

-   Option to apply a wave to the active track for use cases that would benefit from increased expressiveness
