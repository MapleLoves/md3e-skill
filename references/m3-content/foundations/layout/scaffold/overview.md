# Scaffold

A fundamental UI design structure that provides a standard platform for assembling key components

[Overview](<foundations/layout/scaffold/overview>)[Bars](<foundations/layout/scaffold/bars>)[Rails](<foundations/layout/scaffold/rails>)[Panes](<foundations/layout/scaffold/panes>)

## Scaffold

  * Availability & resources

  * The layout scaffold structures every piece of an adaptive layout into bars, rails, and  panes Panes are layout containers that house other components and elements within a single app. A pane can be: fixed, flexible, floating, or semi permanent.  [More on panes](</m3/pages/scaffold/panes>)

  * Bars can frame the page to help people navigate through a product

  * Rails create the perimeter space surrounding panes, creating space for elements like navigation and toolbars

  * Panes hold a product’s primary content, adapting to  breakpoints Breakpoints are opinionated window sizes where a layout changes to match available space, device conventions, and ergonomics (previously window size classes).  [More on breakpoints](</m3/pages/breakpoints>) (previously window size classes) and other conditions
