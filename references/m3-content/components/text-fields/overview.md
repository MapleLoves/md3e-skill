# Text fields

Text fields let users enter text into a UI

## Text fields

  * Availability & resources
  * Differences from M2

  * Make sure text fields look interactive

  * Two variants:  filled Filled text fields have more visual emphasis than outlined text fields. They're often used in dialogs and short forms where their style draws more attention.  and  outlined Outlined text fields have less visual emphasis than filled text fields. They're often used in long forms where their reduced emphasis helps simplify the layout.

  * The text field’s  state States show the interaction status of a component or UI element.  [More on states](</m3/pages/interaction-states/overview>) (blank, with input, error, etc) should be visible at a glance

  * Keep labels and error messages brief and easy to act on

  * Text fields commonly appear in forms and  dialogs Dialogs provide important prompts in a user flow.  [More on dialogs](</m3/pages/dialogs/overview>)

## Differences from M2

  * Color: New color mappings and compatibility with  dynamic color Dynamic color takes a single color from a user's wallpaper or in-app content and creates an accessible color scheme assigned to elements in the UI.  [More on dynamic color](</m3/pages/dynamic/choosing-a-source>)
