# Breakpoints

Breakpoints ensure layouts work across a wide range of devices

[Overview](<foundations/layout/breakpoints/overview>)[Compact](<foundations/layout/breakpoints/compact>)[Medium](<foundations/layout/breakpoints/medium>)[Expanded](<foundations/layout/breakpoints/expanded>)[Large & extra-large](<foundations/layout/breakpoints/large-extra-large>)

## Breakpoints

  * Navigation
  * Panes
  * Spacing
  * Special considerations

Layouts for compact  breakpoints Breakpoints are opinionated window sizes where a layout changes to match available space, device conventions, and ergonomics (previously window size classes).  [More on breakpoints](</m3/pages/breakpoints>) are for **screen widths smaller than 600dp.**

A compact breakpoint focuses on a single view

## Navigation

Use a navigation bar or modal expanded navigation rail.

Place navigation components close to the edge of the screen where they’re easier to reach.

Place navigation elements near the bottom of a compact window so they’re easy to reach

## Panes

Use a single pane in compact layouts.

  1. Single-pane layouts work best for compact breakpoints

## Spacing

Margins are 16dp from the leading and trailing edge of the window.

In compact layouts, use 16dp margins

## Special considerations

A compact layout will need to transition dynamically to a medium or expanded layout when:

  * A foldable device is unfolded

  * A mobile device is rotated from portrait to landscape

  * A tablet exits split-screen mode

  * A product is resized to be larger in multi-window mode

  * A free-form window is resized

Compact layouts should dynamically transition to larger layouts when a device is unfolded or rotated
